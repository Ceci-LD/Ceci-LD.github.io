								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom:1em">Hi! I'm Tsvetelin, a game programmer and a software engineer from Bulgaria, and I've been making games since 13 and playing games from an even younger age. I have finished Software Engineering Bachelor program at <a href="https://en.via.dk/">VIA University College</a> in Denmark, and currently working as a Unity Developer</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom:2em"><a href="#projects"><strong>Here</strong></a> you can see some personal projects that I have created myself, and projects I am currently working on.</p>
								<h3 class="major" style="margin-bottom: 1em">Personal Information</h3>
								<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom:2em">Since I was 9 years old I have never lived in a single country more than 2 consecutive years. I was born in Serbia, although my parents are Bulgarian, and have lived in Bulgaria, South Africa, The United States, Greece, Denmark, Jordan, and Austria. This has taught me to constantly adapt to changes and has led me to become more open minded and empathetic.</p>
								<h3 class="major" style="margin-bottom: 1em">Interests</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Playing RTS and MOBA games</li>
									<li>Playing Basketball</li>
									<li>Drawing Pixel Art</li>

								<h3>Job</h3>
								<ul class="alt">
									<li><strong>Position: </strong> Unity Developer</li>
									<li><strong>Company: </strong> Artivive</li>
									<li><strong>Place: </strong> Vienna, Austria</li>
									<li><strong>Period: </strong> June, 2020 - Present</li>
								</ul>
								<p style = "text-align: justify">As my first job after graduation I have been tasked of recreating a mobile application in Unity for augmented reality artworks. When I began working at Artivive the team consisted only of me and the CTO of the company and a lot of responsibility was put on my shoulders regarding the system design. Yes, a lot of the core features have already been implemented, but I had to put them in the scenario of a game engine which was a task of its own. <br>The main problem I have faced is having guidance. As a Junior I am not supposed to have a lot of work experience, and a helping hand in certain situation is always useful. Having said this I have learned a lot while on my own, and have pushed through many difficult tasks. <br>I am glad that I have worked on features that resemble a game development enviroment such as writing shaders for the graphics pipeline, and creating some complex algorithms for feature logic.</p>
								<h3>Internship</h3>
								<ul class="alt">
									<li><strong>Position: </strong> Software Engineering Intern</li>
									<li><strong>Company: </strong> SevenGate LLC.</li>
									<li><strong>Place: </strong> Amman, Jordan</li>
									<li><strong>Period: </strong> July, 2018 - December, 2018</li>
								</ul>
								<p style = "text-align: justify">During my internship I was in charge with executing delegated tasks from customers on time and with a high quality. I mainly focused on network security and internet protocols, while also helping the front-end team with web development. I completed the internship training early and ahead of time, but decided to extend my training period for one more month. Throughout this period, I received two Sophos XG Firewall certiﬁcates, which can be found below.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify">After my higher education I began studying the principles of game and graphics programming. I didn't think that I was qualified enough for any job at the time, therefore I pushed myself to study the things that I found most interesting.
																Since then, I have been reading a lot of books regarding algorithms, graphics programming, game engine architecture, and machine learning, and have created a few personal projects which reflect my knowledge.</p>

Instead of creating such algorithms to use in individual projects, programmers tend to use pre-existing libraries with these algorithms already implemented. When I started learning JavaScript, I wanted to make sure I haven't forgotten about these algorithms and applied them in a small project. </p>
							<p>I have implemented three sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, heap sort, and quick sort. The application starts with one unsorted array and depending on the algorithm you choose to use, the array will begin to visually get sorted.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify">My first journey into machine learning did not begin with this project. I took a machine learning course during the 6th semester of my Bachelor studies, learning much of the basics and theory for creating neural networks, and using algorithms for the different types of machine "learning". I decided to venture off deeper into the subject and create my own AI that can tackle problems. Initially I started recreating Flappy Bird using the NEAT algorithm, but encountered countless of obstacles until the whole project was rendered useless and unable to work in any way. I messed up big time, but came out with a better understanding of the subject.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">Box jump is a simple 2D game where the player/AI has to jump over incoming boxes. The boxes have a random chance to spawn in one of four different positions. After the initial stage was complete and the player could move and avoid obstacles, it was time to implement the AI.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">The first task was to create the input layer from the box to the neural network. There are total of 7 inputs: x and y position of the player box and the closest enemy box, distance between the closest enemy box and the player box. The hardest part was creating the population and visualizing each individual box. After the connections were done I implemented a small function to change between training the boxes and showing the best box so far.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify">After seeing the 1986 flocking simulation, I decided to read Craig Reynolds' (the inventor) background regarding the Boids. Thereafter I wanted to recreate it by just following the three rules: Alignment, Cohesion and Separation.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">I decided to use JavaScript, because of its simplicity, and p5.js for its easy setup and visualizations. When creating the project, I decided to add a bit more physics to the algorithm, therefore I applied mass to each boid, and having the steering of that boid a bit harder due to its mass. This made the smaller boids more agile, while the larger boids very bulky.</p>

							</ul>
							<p style="text-align: justify">I began my journey into algorithms as any software engineer would. Through watching youtube videos. I was amazed by the sheer number of cool things people could make using algorithms. A few weeks before this project I picked up the "Introduction to algorithms", by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein, and the "Algorithm Design Manual" by Skiena.
							There were so many algorithms that I knew from my Bachelors education, but on the other hand there were also so many that I had never heard about. I dived deeper and deeper into pathfinding algorithms as that piqued my interest.</p>
							<p>To implement the A* algorithm I decided that I needed a language that is very efficient when dealing with computational power, therefore I picked c++. I also needed a way to visualize everything since its pretty boring seeing your console line outputting this:</p>
							<p>
								<code>
									Starting Node = {0, 0} </br>
									Target Node   = {99, 99} </br>
									Algorithm Starting... </br>
									Computing shortest path... </br>
									Shortest path found!
								</code>
							</p>
							<p>For the graphics I chose to use the SFML library as it is easy to pick up, and I was satisfied with having 2d graphics, as I only needed to represent a 2D grid.</p>

							<p>The hardest part was fiquring out how to implement the algorithm in c++, since I am new to the language and there are many simple things I did not know. For example in Java I could use a List for the Open and Closed sets, and since the list has methods already implemented for finding if an element is in the list (Contains) and remove, the algorithm would be way easier to implement.</p>
							<p>Another obstacle I ran into was optimization. By using a normal array (vector) in c++, finding the node with the lowest f cost was very time consuming. I had to implement a min heap to avoid this overhead and that's when other problems occured. I am relatively new to using pointers, and using them efficiently is another task. In the end through trial and error I managed to make the algorithm work by replacing the Open and Closed set with a min heap.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="cpp-A-star/minHeap_replacced.png" alt="" />Code before and after min heap implementation</span>
							<p>I decided to track how much time it would take to run each algorithm (with min heap and without) by using a timer. I implemented a Timer class by following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG4jexlSAjc"> this </a> tutorial.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify"></p>
							<p>For this project I used a maze generating algorithm to draw a NxN maze. At first I thought it would be a simple task, but I encountered a couple of blockers that made me rethink the complexity of the algorithm.</p>
							<p>The first obstacle that I encountered was random. It was literally the random number generator in c++. I noticed that rand() is not as random as one might think. Without knowing this information I thought that my algorithm wasn't working properly, but after thorough research I found new ways to make a random number generator in c++.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mazeRand.png" alt="" />Choosing a random neighbor</span>
							<p>To draw the walls of the cell I decided to draw 4 individual rectangles to represent each wall (up, down, left, right). This made it easier when making the made, since in order to connect two cells together, I would just destroy the walls that are inbetween them.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mazeWalls.png" alt=""/>The four walls of each cell</span>
							<p>Implementing the stack was relatively easy, since I know the data structure and have used it previously. The only confusing thing was that when calling pop(), it did not return the actual element from the stack. I had to use top() to get the element, and then call pop().</p>
							<p>The hardest part by far was the actual visualization. I had to find a way to visualize each cell whenever it was visited, or backtracked from the stack.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/d3d11.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p style="text-align: justify"></p>
							<p>This is a project I wanted to tackle for a very long time. I have read and heard hundreds if not thousands of blog posts, forums, opinions, and books saying to never try and create a game engine on your own. I know it is a task that one can fully achieve only in a lifetime (still debatable), but I wanted to do it anyways. I don't want to recreate the next Unity or Unreal, but a small sandbox for me to play around with and learn new things about the DirectX API.</p>
							<p>After reading Jason Gregory's 'Game Engine Architecture' book, I really wanted to go through that process myself. DISCLAIMER! I do not want to make game engines or renderers. I want to be a game developer, but what good is it making games if I can't understand the technology behind them?</p>
							
							<p>Having said all of this, I began my project by researching. As always I watched through countless of videos, read two more books ('3D game programming with directX 11' by Frank D. Luna, and '3D Game Engine Architecture' by David H. Eberly) until I reached a point where I felt somewhat confident in tackling it on my own (Spoiler alert, I had plenty of external help).</p>
							
							<p>I know some people can judge and say "Hey you copied this from *insert fictional palce here*!!!", and yes I did, but frankly I do not care. This is a learning experience and I don't think any human can tackle game engines completely alone from the first try.</p>
							<p>I began by following some video tutorials by ChilliTomatoNoodle on youtube. He explained a lot of things that were unclear to me, and taught me a lot of useful techniques not only for DirectX 11, but C++ as well.</p>
							<p>Still learning and trying to find any free time I can to work on this project, I am extremely happy I have finally decided to do something about my dream.</p>
